# Waste-Management-

## OVERVIEW

The Smart Waste Sorting System operates through a Python command-line
interface which performs automatic waste classification for Plastic,
Paper, Metal, Glass, and Compost categories. The program uses keyword
detection to analyse item descriptions which helps it determine the
proper sorting bin for each item. If the item cannot be identified, it
marks it as Unknown and rejects it.

The project provides a basic understanding of AI logic and string
processing and decision-making techniques through Python programming.

## FEATURES

-   Automatic item classification based on description keywords\
-   Five waste categories + Unknown category\
-   Smart bin assignment with bin numbers\
-   Clear console messages for each item\
-   Allows the user to enter multiple items at once\
-   Simple to test and modify

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

-   Python 3.13\
-   Built-in functions (input, print, conditionals, loops)\
-   No external libraries required

## INSTALLATION & RUNNING THE PROJECT

### PREREQUISITES

-   Install Python 3.13\
-   Clone the Repository\
-   Navigate to the Project Folder\
-   Run the Program `waste-generator.py`

## TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

Examples: - "red crinkly bottle" → Plastic\
- "newspaper" → Paper\
- "shiny can" → Metal\
- "transparent jar" → Glass\
- "banana peel" → Compost\
- "stone" → Unknown

## HOW IT WORKS

-   Stores bin numbers for each waste category\
-   Asks the user for multiple items\
-   Converts description to lowercase\
-   Checks keywords\
-   Finds matching category\
-   Prints whether item is accepted
